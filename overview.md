Manage your content

1- Now your content can be edited easily by your non-technical team in a realtime collaboration. The edition can be in Markdown as well as in HTML directly (personally, i recommend Markdown).

2- You have an editor with a preview of what you and your collaborators are writing in realtime, as you would do on Google Drive.

3- You can save your changes as a Draft or as a Release. The production only sees the releases, while your development team can hook on the draft saves.

4- You can go in the history to review old versions (with their changes) and rollback to a specific version if necessary.

5- You can cut your document in fragments for a smoother integration.
